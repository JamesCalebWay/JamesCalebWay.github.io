## Project description

The To Do List is a simple application that allows the user to add tasks to a list and remove them. The user can also delete all tasks if needed.

## How to use the program

To use the To Do List, just click on the red text "Add New TODO" then type in a task and hit the enter key. This will add your task to the list of tasks.

If you need to delete a task just hover over the desired task. Then click the trashcan that appears to the left of the task. Also, in the bottom-left corner there is a button to delete all the tasks in the list.

If you want to hide "Add New TODO", click the add symbol (+) in the top-right corner. Click it again if you need to add another task.

## Here's an example

<codepen-embed penId="ab123r">
    <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="YzNyVxK" data-user="JCWay" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
