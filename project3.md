## Project description

Castle of Conquest is a text-based adventure game where a player traverses through a series of areas, fighting monsters along the way. The player must make their way through four levels before they face off against the final boss to protect their land and win the game. Your hero, guided by a fairy named Nova, must find their way through the land of Ukro to stop the corrupted king in his evil ways.

At the start of the game the user will be able to name their character (Fig 1.).

Once a name is chosen, you will be asked to accept the quest. If you chose "no", then the game will end (Fig 2).

If the play accepts the quest then they will start battle (Fig 3).
